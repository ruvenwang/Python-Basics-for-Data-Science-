# Python Basics for Data Science
This repository contains the final assignment for the **Python Basics for Data Science** course, which demonstrates fundamental Python concepts and techniques used in data science.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to showcase proficiency in basic Python programming for data science, focusing on:

- **Data Types and Structures**: Understanding variables, data types (e.g., integers, floats, strings), and data structures like lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
- **Control Flow**: Implementing conditionals, loops, and error handling in Python.
- **Functions**: Creating reusable code by defining functions and exploring lambda expressions.
- **Basic Data Operations**: Loading, manipulating, and processing data using Pythonâ€™s built-in functions and libraries.
- **Libraries for Data Science**: Familiarity with popular Python libraries like NumPy and Pandas for handling numerical data and tabular data, respectively.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, and any other common Python libraries for data manipulation
